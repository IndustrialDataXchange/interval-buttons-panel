This panel supports multipliers allowing you to navigate the interval based on the selected multiplication factor. This can be disabled in the options.

## Options

The multiplier can be hidden using the show multiplier toggle.

Interval buttons can be added by entering an interval value (numeric) and selecting an interval type (minute, hour, day, month). 

Interval buttons can be removed by clicking the delete button found next to created interval buttons.
